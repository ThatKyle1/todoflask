# To do App

Created a To-Do app using Flask. Created a simple app that allowed for added todo's and buttons to add the todo's, buttons to update the completion of todo's,
and buttons to remove the todo's. Used knowledge of Python and HTML. Used SQLAlchemy (SQLite) to connect with databases this work well with Flask. For neater looking UI
used semantic UI for neater and simplier way of adding customizable designs to my HTML code.
